# Ultimate-AdBlock for Safari
Ad + Tracker + Social (Content) Blocker for iOS & OSX written in Swift, using the new Content Blocker API for fast blocking.
Blocks hostnames and hides CSS Ads Elements. The project is in active development.

## Content Blocker API VS JavaScript Blockers
We all know them, the browser extensions that block ads and trackers. Some of them are fast and most of them use massive amounts of memory to block everything. 
The more lists you subscribe to, the slower the browser is. You may have seen it in the statusbar when loading a webpage: "Waiting for extension *name*".
These lists are created in the last decade and contain elements that were found on some webpage at some point. There are also duplicate items for multiple websites and items.
This list is refreshed automagically (~ every week). The browser extension makes a network connection, downloads the new list and stores it without you knowing it.
While this is fine for most users and has been for the last decade, there must be a better and faster way to protect your privacy.

Thankfully Apple has created a new Content Blocker API for Safari (iOS & OSX).

The goal of this extension is the following:

- Never make a network connection
- Never send (anonymous) usage statistics
- Block most advertisements, trackers & social services
- Don't slow down the page

The extensions never makes any network connection. The only way to update the filters is to update the extension itself, and that's fine.
The complete blockerList.json consists of JSON rules that are delivered to Safari. For more info, please check "About the Safari Content Blocker API" below.

## Filters
Ultimate AdBlock uses a couple of filters;

### Hostnames
- [pgl.yoyo.org Adserver hostnames](https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/), updated 16 April 2016
- [EasyList Blocklist (Section: Third-party advertisers)](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt), updated 16 April 2016
- [EasyList Privacy (Section: Third-party tracking domains)](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt), updated 25 April 2016
- Custom hostnames, updated 6 March 2017

### CSS Element Hiding
- [Fanboys Social Blocklist (Section: General Element Hiding Rules)](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/fanboy-social.txt), updated 10 April 2016
- [EasyList Blocklist (Section: General Element Hiding Rules)](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt), updated 10 April 2016
- Custom Anti AdBlock CSS elements, updated 10 April 2016
- Custom Ads CSS elements, updated 10 April 2016
- Custom Social sharing CSS elements, updated 10 April 2016
- Javascript files, updated 6 March 2017

All block data is stored in .txt files. Some have different formats. For example the pgl.yoyo adservers are all on one line, seperated with a comma.
The other filters are different. Every host is stored on a new line, for clarity.

By default all filters are enabled. If you want to disable a filter (for example the social css elements) you can do so by setting the correct variable in update-filters.swift to false. Run the script again to generate fresh filters.
